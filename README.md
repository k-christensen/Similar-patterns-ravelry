This function is an offshoot of the Ravelry project currently being worked on.

Using the read only ravelry permissions, this function takes an input of a pattern url, and the output is a search url for patterns with similar attributes. 

`similar_patterns.py` this is the main function

`read_only.py` this contains the read_only permissions

`yarn_id_dict.p` pickle file that contains the dictionary that has all yarn weights and ID numbers I've assigned to them based on ascending order (i.e. the smallest weight is 0 and the largest weight is 12)
